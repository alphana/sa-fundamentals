# Understanding Software System Qualities
<v-clicks depth="4">

## Quality Attributes
- **Definition:** Quality attributes are measurable or testable properties of a system that indicate how well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders ([Bass et al., "Software Architecture in Practice"](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Bass-Software-Architecture-in-Practice-3rd-Edition/9780321815736.html)).
  - Examples include performance, scalability, reliability, and other characteristics that directly impact the overall quality of a software system.

# Understanding Software System Qualities
<v-clicks depth="2">

## Quality Goal
- **Quality Goal:** A high-level statement that expresses a desired outcome related to a specific quality attribute ([Clements et al., "Documenting Software Architectures"](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Clements-Documenting-Software-Architectures-Views-and-Beyond-2nd-Edition/9780321552686.html)).
  - Quality goals provide a broader perspective on what needs to be achieved in terms of system qualities.
  - Example: "Achieve high performance to ensure rapid response times for user interactions."
</v-clicks>

# Understanding Software System Qualities
<v-clicks depth="2">

## Quality Requirement
- **Quality Requirement:** A specific, detailed statement that defines a constraint or condition that the system must meet concerning a quality attribute ([ISO/IEC 25010 - Systems and Software Engineering](https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html)).
  - Quality requirements provide actionable criteria for evaluating the success of the system's architecture.
  - Example: "The system must respond to user requests within 2 seconds for 95% of interactions."

# Understanding Software System Qualities
<v-clicks depth="2">

## Quality Importance
- **Quality Importance:** The relative significance of a particular quality attribute or requirement in the context of the overall system ([Bass et al., "Software Architecture in Practice"](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Bass-Software-Architecture-in-Practice-3rd-Edition/9780321815736.html)).
  - Assessing and assigning importance helps in prioritizing efforts and resources during the design and development phases.
  - Example: "In this project, user experience (performance) is of high importance due to real-time user interactions."
